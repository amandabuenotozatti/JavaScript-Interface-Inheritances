## Interfaces and Inheritance

#### Code sharing and maintenance
- Recalling concepts of classes and properties
- Best practices when declaring attributes
- Always declaring properties to be private initially
- Code duplication issues
- Extremely shared code issues

#### Inheritance
- Specializing code
- Inheriting properties and attributes
- Method overloading
- Sharing code securely
- Keeping our code in the client's language
- Avoiding overly complicated code through inheritance
- Keyword "super"
- Private and protected method and properties

#### Abstract Classes
> Abstract classes can be defined as classes that cannot be instantiated i.e. whose object reference cannot be created and contains within it, one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that can only be declared but has no implementation to it.
- Creating a new Error message that stop the application when user tries to breach the creation of a new account using the abstract class Account.


#### Polymorphism and interfaces
> The polymorphism is a core concept of an object-oriented paradigm that provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. It provides an ability to call the same method on different JavaScript objects.
- Structuring the project with the new Employees folder.
- Applying the principle of inheritance to different types of employees.
- Inheritance review, good code practices and encapsulation
- Polymorphism 
- Static methods
- Ways to treat different types of objects in a similar way
